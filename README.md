# AIWrap
A novel Artificial Intelligence based Wrapper (AIWrap) algorithm that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) with wrapper based feature selection. The algorithm develops a Performance Prediction Model using AI which predicts the model performance of any feature set and allows wrapper based methods to evaluate the feature subset performance in a model without building the model. The algorithm can make wrapper based method more relevant for high-dimensional data and is flexible to be applicable in any wrapper based method.
